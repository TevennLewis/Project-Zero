-In this game you are a demon slayer trying to attain the rank of hashira. The timer above is representative of 2 years.
-As the timer winds down, you will be required to keep up your training! The three buttons on the bottom of the page will allow you go keep your skills sharp so you aren't eaten by a demon before achieving your goal
-The bars above the three training buttons are on a scale of 1-10, if you are not keeping up with your respective training and the bars fall below 1, game over you were eaten by a demon
-Conversely, if you keep up with your training over the time frame, you will level up in rank!
-When rank is increased, this will increase the difficulty meaning, the training bars will deplete quicker making it more difficult to keep up with your training.
(Potential stretch goal: also as you rank up your timer will extend in order for you to spend the time needed to become an even higher rank)
-To win the game, you must rank up 3 times in order to become a hashira!
